INTRODUCTORY STATEMENT:

From the PDR to the CDR, a few people have left the team as they are no longer interested, and our roles have changed
significantly, such as a change in project manager and removing titles such as secretary. Due to people leaving the team
 unannounced and a relatively low amount of team members contribution, we are not at the stage we expected or wanted to be at. 
We intend to compensate for this during our build and test phase of the rover as we have now reformed our team.
